# File that defines endpoints for exposing Prometheus metrics for SQL result sets.
# It talks to a [SQL Agent](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/sql-agent) service that
# performs the query against the target database and returns the result set.
# The `driver`, `connection`, `sql`, and `params` options defined for each endpoint
# are passed to the service to execute the query. The other options are specific
# to this service.

# Name of the metric. Will be exposed as query_result_num_products
- num_products:
    # Name of the driver to use.
    driver: postgresql

    # Connection information.
    connection:
        host: example.org
        port: 5432
        user: postgres
        password: s3cre7
        database: products

    # SQL string. Parameters are name-based (not positional) and must be
    # prefixed with a colon. See `:category_id` in the query below for an example.
    # Must return single row, single column
    sql: >
        select count(product_id)
        from product
            inner join product_category
                on (product.category_id = product_category.id)
            inner join product_category_idx
                on (product_category.id = product_category_idx.category_id)
        where product_category_idx.category_id = :category_id
            or product_category_idx.ancestor_category_id = :category_id

    # Parameter values by name.
    params:
        category_id: 5

    # The time between query execution. This should be set relative to the frequency
    # of expected updates and the required granularity of changes.
    interval: 1h

    # value on error, default is null
    # if not null, when query has error, will use this value to indicate an error has occured
    #value-on-error: '-1'

# For faceted metrics provide the name of the metric-column in config, and return a resultset of multiple columns and rows
- sales_by_country:
    # Name of the driver to use.
    driver: postgresql

    # Connection information.
    connection:
        host: example.org
        port: 5432
        user: postgres
        password: s3cre7
        database: products

    sql: >
        select country, count(1) as cnt from sales

    # The time between query execution. This should be set relative to the frequency
    # of expected updates and the required granularity of changes.
    interval: 1h

    # The value for our metric is in "cnt", other columns are facets (exposed as labels)
