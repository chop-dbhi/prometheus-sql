`example-queries.yml` contains some examples how to use Prometheus SQL with just a single query file.

In sub directory `working_example` will use a configuration and query file which also contains configuration errors to show how that appears in the logs etc. To run the example you only need to go into the directory and run `docker-compose up` and to destroy it run `docker-compose down`.
